\f1\i0 : Hey, everyone! Thanks for coming today. I've been thinking about a new startup idea lately.

\f0\i\fs32 \cf2 \strokec2 Emily
\f1\i0 : Oh, that sounds exciting! What's the concept?
\f2\fs24 \cf0 \strokec3 \

\f0\i\fs32 \cf2 \strokec2 Alex
\f1\i0 : Well, it's about an app that connects local artisans with customers looking for unique handmade products.
\f2\fs24 \cf0 \strokec3 \

\f0\i\fs32 \cf2 \strokec2 Chris
\f1\i0 : That's interesting. How would you ensure the quality of the products?
\f2\fs24 \cf0 \strokec3 \

\f0\i\fs32 \cf2 \strokec2 Alex
\f1\i0 : We'd implement a rigorous vetting process, ensuring that each artisan meets specific criteria for craftsmanship and authenticity.

\f1\i0 : I love the idea of supporting local artisans! How would you market this app?
\f2\fs24 \cf0 \strokec3 \

\f0\i\fs32 \cf2 \strokec2 Alex

\f0\i\fs32 \cf2 \strokec2 Ryan
\f1\i0 : Have you thought about the revenue model?
\f2\fs24 \cf0 \strokec3 \

\f0\i\fs32 \cf2 \strokec2 Alex
\f1\i0 : Initially, the app could take a small commission from each sale. As we grow, premium features for artisans or subscription models could also generate income.
\f2\fs24 \cf0 \strokec3 \

\f0\i\fs32 \cf2 \strokec2 Olivia
\f1\i0 : What about scalability? How do you plan to expand this beyond one city or region?
\f2\fs24 \cf0 \strokec3 \

\f0\i\fs32 \cf2 \strokec2 Alex
\f1\i0 : That's a challenge. Initially, focusing on one area allows us to perfect the model, but eventually, we could replicate the approach in different cities or partner with existing artisan networks.

\f0\i\fs32 \cf2 \strokec2 Emily
\f1\i0 : What's the timeline for development and launch?
\f2\fs24 \cf0 \strokec3 \

\f0\i\fs32 \cf2 \strokec2 Alex
\f1\i0 : I envision a six-month development period, collaborating closely with artisans for their feedback. A soft launch within a year and then scaling up as we refine the user experience.
\f2\fs24 \cf0 \strokec3 \

\f0\i\fs32 \cf2 \strokec2 Chris
\f1\i0 : What kind of team would you need to execute this?

\f0\i\fs32 \cf2 \strokec2 Alex
\f1\i0 : We'd need a diverse team\'97tech experts for app development, marketing professionals, and individuals experienced in working with artisans and small businesses.
\f2\fs24 \cf0 \strokec3 \

\f0\i\fs32 \cf2 \strokec2 Maya
\f1\i0 : I'm curious about the social impact. How does this benefit the artisans and the community?
\f2\fs24 \cf0 \strokec3 \

\f0\i\fs32 \cf2 \strokec2 Alex
\f1\i0 : By providing a platform for these artisans, we empower them economically and help preserve traditional craftsmanship. Plus, supporting local businesses strengthens the community.
\f2\fs24 \cf0 \strokec3 \

\f0\i\fs32 \cf2 \strokec2 Ryan
\f1\i0 : Have you considered potential challenges or competition?
\f2\fs24 \cf0 \strokec3 \
